## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe for "The Odin Project". In this project we learned about factory functions and module pattern.

We got the task to find how to incorporate factory functions and module pattern for this small game of Tic Tac Toe.

I've used factory function to create players. And the module pattern for my gameboard, displayText, etc..

Also, how to write the logic for the game like switching turns, checking the winning combinations and also being able to play multiple rounds.


## Extra's I've added

My first idea was a bit different, instead of just creating a random restuarant page with placeholder content, I wanted to make a full website with content that's going to fit the theme. So I've started thinking how will this website look. Also, I've made it in a way so that It's fully responsive on smaller screens. But at the same time to incorporate Webpack and It's features.
