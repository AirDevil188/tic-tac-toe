## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe for "The Odin Project". In this project we learned about factory functions and module pattern.

We got the task to find how to incorporate factory functions and module pattern for this small game of Tic Tac Toe.

I've used factory function to create players. And the module pattern for my gameboard, displayText, etc..

Also, how to write the logic for the game like switching turns, checking the winning combinations and also being able to play multiple rounds.


## Extra's I've added

Option to insert names to the players, also in order to win the game you must win three rounds.
